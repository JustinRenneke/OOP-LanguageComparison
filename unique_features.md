## Unique features of the language
### Python
Python doesn't really have any features that are completely unique across all languages - even its use of whitespace for structure can be seen in Haskell. However, the combination of many of its features gives it a unique power to increase productivity and ease of prototyping. It is widely agreed that, while it may be lacking in some areas of performance when compared to other object oriented languages, it is the best language for rapidly prototyping software using fewer lines of code and having fantastic readability. That said, Python includes some features that are somewhat special such as: use of indentation; interactive interpreter; collections being first class; functions being first class; and use of generators and coroutines.
### C#
C# could be said to be unique in the fact that at first it was nearly a straight copy of Java - most programming languages are created with some goal of improving on previous languages or adding new features. Eventually C# began to diverge from Java and has come to incorporate some special features including: assemblies; cross-language compatibility being first class (Common Language Runtime); properties, listeners, and foreign methods (extension methods) being first class; and use of partial classes.
